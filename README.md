# Sensor Metadata Application

## Task
Please build a JSON REST API for storing and querying sensor metadata.
At a minimum, this API should expose endpoints for the following:
- Storing name, location (gps position), and a list of tags for each sensor.
- Retrieving metadata for an individual sensor by name.
- Updating a sensorâ€™s metadata.
- Querying to find the sensor nearest to a given location.

It is up to you how you structure your application, but please write it in Go and include anything you would
in a professional project (i.e.: README, tests, input validation, etc).
